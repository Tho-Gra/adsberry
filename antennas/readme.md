# Antennas for ADS-B reception
There are different Antennas on the market cheap ones as well as expensive ones. Some perform very decently while other models are not working at all.
We like to bild our own antennas which should be:
* Cheap to build
* Easy to build
* Small so installation is not an issue
* Long range

## The groundplane
The groundplane ist very cheap to make and is a decent performer when build to spec.
### Whats good
* Cheap
* Easy to build
* Good reception

### Whats not so good
* Looks homemade
* Fragile when transported, not so much when installed
* You may need a VNA to tune it to the optimal performance

### Parts needed
* N socket
* 40cm copper wire (1.5mm² or better 2.5mm²)
* 4 M3 bolts and nuts (you may want to add washers)
* SMA -> N RG58 cable to connect it to your bandpassfilter an rtl_sdr (length depends on your setup, the shorter the better, we usualy use 1m)

### Tools needes
* Soldering iron + solder
* Wrench for the M3 nuts or Pliers
* Wirecutter
* Screwdriver for the M3 screws

### Building the Antenna
* cut 4 about 8cm long copper pieces and create a loop on each end which is big enoug for a M3 screw [picture](gp01.jpg)
* solder the loops end for mor stability [picture](gp02.jpg)
* cut one 8cm long copper pice [picture](gp03.jpg) and solder it into the antenna jacks middle pin [picture](gp04.jpg)
* screw the four pieces withe the loops to the antenna at an 45° angle [picture](gp05.jpg) and bend them down 45° [picture](gp06.jpg)
* Cut each of the 5 copper pieces to exactly 68mm [picture](gp07.jpg)
* Connect the antenna and install it in an upright position with clear line of sight
